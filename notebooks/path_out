0,2020-01-22,TE Connectivity introduces M12 industrial Ethernet cable assembly,"TE Connectivity (TE) now offers M12 data cable assemblies that support Ethernet protocols as part of its package of Industrial Ethernet and Fieldbus solutions.
Users of the new TE M12 industrial Ethernet cable assemblies can choose from a wide range of features. Jacketing, for example, is in PVC, or halogen-free PUR or other FRNC (flame retardant, non-corrosive) materials.
PVC provides a competitive and economic solution for occasional movement or vibration, but lacks in areas such as flex properties, while PUR is more suited to more demanding applications in, for example, drag chains and harsh environments where operational reliability is crucial.
Depending on the material, the M12 assemblies withstand up to 1 million flexes, machine oils, abrasion and UV radiation. A compact full-metal housing with crimp flange/crimp sleeve provides 360-degree shielding against EMI/RFI interference.
The hexagonal crimp of the sleeve gives a vibration-resistant and torsion-proof cable strain relief, in accordance with IEC 61 373, Category 1, Class B, as well as safe shield termination. Category 5e cables can realize transmission rates of 100Mbps to meet network requirements in the field and at supervisory management levels.
The new assemblies are available with several standard cable length options from 0.5m through to 30m.",https://www.automationmag.com/te-connectivity-introduces-m12-industrial-ethernet-cable-assembly/,empty
1,2020-01-22,Kirigami designs hold thousands of times their own weight,"The Japanese art of origami (from ori, folding, and kami, paper) transforms flat sheets of paper into complex sculptures. Variations include kirigami (from kiri, to cut), a version of origami that allows materials to be cut and reconnected using tape or glue.
But while both art forms are a source of ideas for science, architecture, and design, each has fundamental limitations. The flat folds required by origami result in an unlockable overall structure, while kirigami creations can't be unfolded back into their original, flattened states because of the adhesive.
Taking inspiration from both art forms, researchers describe a new set of motifs for creating lightweight, strong, and foldable structures using soft materials. These kirigami structures can support 14,000 times their weight and, because they don't require adhesives or fasteners, can easily be flattened and refolded. Published in Physical Review X, the work was conducted by visiting graduate student Xinyu Wang and professor Randall Kamien of the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with Simon Guest from the University of Cambridge.
Wang, a Ph.D. student at Southeast University, was interested in studying the mechanical properties of origami and kirigami structures and reached out to Kamien to start a new collaboration. After Wang arrived at the Kamien lab in September 2018, Kamien asked her to try some new designs using his group's set of rules for exploring kirigami structures.
Shortly thereafter, Wang showed Kamien a new design for a kirigami triangle that had tilted walls. Kamien was initially surprised to see that Wang had left the excess flaps from the cuts in place. ""The usual kirigami route is to cut that off and tape it,"" says Kamien. Wang ""found that, in this particular geometry, you can get the flaps to fit.""
While a single triangle wasn't particularly strong on its own, the researchers noticed that when several were arranged in a repetitive design, the force they could support was much greater than expected. ""Here was this structure that didn't require tape, it had cuts, and it was really strong,"" Kamien says. ""Suddenly, we have this system that we hadn't anticipated at all.""
To figure out what made this geometry so resilient, Wang made several versions of different ""soft"" materials, including paper, copper, and plastic. She also made versions where the cut flaps were taped, cut, or damaged. Using industry-grade tension and compression testing equipment at the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter, the scientists found that the geometric structure could support 14,000 times its own weight. The tilted, triangular design was strongest when the flaps were undamaged and untapped, and it was also stronger than the same design with vertical walls.
With the help of Guest, the researchers realized that two deviations from the group's typical kirigami rules were key to the structure's strength. When the walls of the triangles are angled, any force applied to the top can be translated into horizontal compression within the center of the design. ""With the vertical ones, there's no way to turn a downward force into a sideways force without bending the paper,"" says Kamien. They also found that the paper-to-paper overlap from leaving the cut flaps in place allowed the triangles to press up against their neighbors, which helped distribute the vertical load.
This paper is yet another example of how kirigami can be used as a ""tool"" for scientists and engineers, this time for creating strong, rigid objects out of soft materials. ""We figured out how to use materials that can bend and stretch, and we can actually strengthen these materials,"" says Wang. One possible application could be to make inexpensive, lightweight, and deployable structures, such as temporary shelter tents that are strong and durable but can also be easily assembled and disassembled.
Kamien also pictures this Interleaved Kirigami Extension Assembly as a way to create furniture in the future. ""Someday, you'll go to IKEA, you fold the box into the furniture, and the only thing inside is the cushion. You don't need any of those connectors or little screws,"" says Kamien.
Thanks to Wang's ""inspired"" design and Kamien's burgeoning collaboration with Wang and her advisors Jianguo Cai and Jian Feng , the possibilities for future ideas and designs are endless. ""There were things about this study that are totally outside the scope of what a physicist would know,"" says Kamien. ""It was this perfect blend of what I could do and what she could do.""

2,2020-01-22,GM's Cruise heads down new road with new robotaxi concept,"General Motors' self-driving car company will attempt to deliver on its long-running promise to provide a more environmentally friendly ride-hailing service in an unorthodox vehicle designed to eliminate the need for human operators to transport people around crowded cities.
The service still being developed by GM's Cruise subsidiary will rely on a boxy, electric-powered vehicle called ""Origin"" that was unveiled late Tuesday in San Francisco amid much fanfare. It looks like a cross between a mini-van and sports utility vehicle with one huge exception—it won't have any steering wheel or brakes. The Origin will accommodate up to four passengers at a time, although a single customer will be able summon it for a ride just as people already can ask for a car with a human behind the wheel from Uber or Lyft.
For all the hype surrounding the Origin's unveiling, Cruise omitted some key details, including when its ride-hailing service will be available and how many of the vehicles will be in its fleet. The company indicated it will initially only be available in San Francisco, where Cruise has already been offering a ride-hailing service that's only available to its roughly 1,000 employees.
By eliminating the need for a human to drive, Cruise theoretically will be able to offer a less expensive way to get around—a goal already being pursued by self-driving car pioneer Waymo, a Google spinoff that has been testing robotaxis in the Phoenix area for nearly three years.
Cruise had planned to have a robotaxi service consisting of Chevrolet Bolts working without human backup drivers by the end of 2019, but moved away from that last year after one of Uber's autonomous test vehicles ran down and killed a pedestrian in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, Arizona, during 2018.
Still aware of the fallout from that deadly crash, Cruise is promising ""superhuman performance"" from the Cruise, which GM hopes to manufacture at half the price of comparable vehicles using fuel-combustion engines. GM also expects to announce where the Origin will be made within the next few weeks, Cruise CEO Dan Amman said.
The Origin won't be sold to consumers though. ""It is not a product you can buy, but an experience you share,"" Amman said.
The Origin represents another significant step for Cruise, which had only 40 employees when GM bought it in 2016 as part of its effort to catch up in the race to build cars that can drive themselves. Since then, Cruise has attracted more than $6 billion from investors, including $2.75 billion from Honda and $2.25 billion from Japanese tech investment firm SoftBank. Honda also helped develop the Origin.
GM currently values Cruise at $19 billion, fueling speculation that the subsidiary may eventually be spun off as a publicly traded company.
Whenever Cruise's ride-hailing service makes its debut, it will still be chasing Waymo, whose work on self-driving car technology began inside of Google more than a decade ago.
Waymo's Phoenix-area service already has given more than 100,000 rides, according to the company. It expanded beyond the test phase service 13 months ago with a ride-hailing app that now has about 1,500 active monthly riders, Waymo says.
By comparison, ride-hailing leader Uber now boasts about 103 million active monthly users with a service that relies on human drivers—a dependence that is the main reason the company has been losing money throughout its history. Despite the fatal 2018 crash that stoked the public's worst fears about self-driving cars, Uber is still trying to build a fleet of robotic taxis as part of its question to become profitable.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also pledged that his company's electric cars will be able to drive themselves without a human behind the wheel before the end of this year so they can moonlight as taxis when their owners don't need the vehicles, but industry analysts doubt that promise will come to fruition.

3,2020-01-22,First fully integrated flexible electronics made of magnetic sensors and organic circuits,"Human skin is a fascinating multifunctional organ with unique properties originating from its flexible and compliant nature. It allows for interfacing with external physical environment through numerous receptors interconnected with the nervous system. Scientists have been trying to transfer these features to artificial skin for a long time, aiming at robotic applications.
Robotic systems heavily rely on electronic and magnetic field sensing functionalities required for positioning and orientation in space. Much research has been devoted to implementation of these functionalities in a flexible, compliant form. Recent advancements in flexible sensors and organic electronics have provided important prerequisites. These devices can operate on soft and elastic surfaces, whereas sensors perceive various physical properties and transmit them via readout circuits.
To closely replicate natural skin, it is necessary to interconnect a large number of individual sensors. This challenging task became a major obstacle in realizing electronic skin. First demonstrations were based on an array of individual sensors addressed separately, which unavoidably resulted in a tremendous number of electronic connections. In order to reduce the necessary wiring, important technology had to be developed—namely, complex electronic circuits, current sources and switches had to be combined with individual magnetic sensors to achieve fully integrated devices.
Researchers from Dresden, Chemnitz and Osaka have now presented a pioneering active matrix magnetic sensor system in a recent article published in Science Advances. The sensor system consists of a 2 x 4 array of magnetic sensors, an organic bootstrap shift register required for controlling the sensor matrix, and organic signal amplifiers. All electronic components are based on organic thin-film transistors and are integrated within a single platform.
The researchers have demonstrated the system's high magnetic sensitivity, and it can acquire the two-dimensional magnetic field distribution in real time. It is also very robust against mechanical deformation, such as bending, creasing or kinking. In addition to full system integration, the use of organic bootstrap shift registers is a very important development step toward active-matrix electronic skin for robotic and wearable applications.
Prof. Dr. Oliver G. Schmidt, director at the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden, says, ""Our first integrated magnetic functionalities prove that thin-film flexible magnetic sensors can be integrated within complex organic circuits. The ultra-compliant and flexible nature of these devices is an indispensable feature for modern and future applications such as soft robotics, implants and prosthetics. The next step is to increase the number of sensors per surface area as well as to expand the electronic skin to fit larger surfaces.""

4,2020-01-22,Study says that we trust our workplace robots,"The only constant is change. Presumptions harden as truth but then there is occasion to throw presumptions off the table and start again. That's the deal with information technology using AI for business and with robots unleashed in the workplace. The presumptions are that such tech is potentially harmful and that if those robots rebel against you, you're toast.
A new study has a sunnier view. People have more trust in robots. ""The majority (65 percent) of workers are optimistic, excited and grateful about having robot co-workers and nearly a quarter report having a loving and gratifying relationship with AI at work,"" said the press release provided by Oracle.
The information comes from an annual study that Oracle runs with the research company Future Workplace. The title of the report is ""Artificial Intelligence Is Winning More Hearts and Minds in the Workplace."" That is quite the positive headline; is it an aggressive spin or a realistic reflection that people are so amenable to workplace AI?
Responses were taken from 8,370 employees, managers and HR leaders across 10 countries. (And why not at least ask: Whether responses would be good or negative, AI has changed the work environment and influences how human resources and managers behave in order to keep organizations on track.)
Judith Humphrey, the founder of a Toronto-based communications firm, in Fast Company had a look at the study. She thought it presented ""a strong case that AI is already winning the hearts and minds of employees.""
Consider technologies that remove the grunt work so that managers can turn to more creative pursuits; the technologies that teach workers how to maximize communications via imaginative digital platforms; technologies that add weight to their career portfolios as they seek promotions or new jobs.
Humphrey noted study results: ""New technologies, according to respondents, will help them master new skills (36%), gain more free time (36%), and expand their current role so that it's more strategic (28%).""
With that said, people outside Oracle still may not easily accept the very thought of an employee at any company trusting a machine more than a human manager to ""do the right thing"" or make the right assessment.
A closer look at the survey questions, though, indicate the response was significant; the outcome had its own logic.
What, specifically, were the activities that respondents felt could be done better by robots than by their managers? These were (1) providing unbiased information, (2) maintaining work schedules, (3) problem solving and (4) managing a budget.
Increased adoption of AI at work is having an impact on the way employees interact with their managers. The traditional role of HR teams and the manager is shifting.
Oracle's press summary of the findings noted that ""64 percent of people would trust a robot more than their manager and half have turned to a robot instead of their manager for advice.""
As for Oracle's press release headline, ""Artificial Intelligence Is Winning More Hearts and Minds in the Workplace,"" it is not an inaccurate spin but more a snippet from a larger thought. AI is winning more hearts and minds in the realm of what AI is good at doing, leaving room and time for managers to do what they do best, coach, motivate, inspire, build teams.
Jeanne Meister, founding partner, Future Workplace: ""As workers and managers leverage the power of artificial intelligence in the workplace, they are moving from fear to enthusiasm as they see the possibility of being freed of many of their routine tasks and having more time to solve critical business problems for the enterprise.""
Humphrey in Fast Company did not miss the part in the study where respondents pinned what,, on the flip side, their managers did better than robots: ""understanding my feelings,"" ""coaching me,"" ""creating or promoting a work culture"" and ""evaluating team performance.""
A prophetic enough article appeared back in 2016 in Harvard Business Review where the authors argued that artificial intelligence will soon be able to do the administrative tasks that consume much of managers' time faster, better, and at a lower cost.
The authors reflected on study findings at the time. The attitude was encouraging; managers could see the difference between intelligently leveraging AI for decision support and data-driven solutions as opposed to fighting AI as a threat leading to their removal, leadership skills and all.
""Writing earnings reports is one thing, but developing messages that can engage a workforce and provide a sense of purpose is human through and through,"" the authors wrote. ""Tracking schedules and resources may soon fall within the jurisdiction of machines, but drafting strategy remains unmistakably human. Simply put, our recommendation is to adopt AI in order to automate administration and to augment but not replace human judgment.""
In the Oracle study, meanwhile, workers in India (89 percent) and China (88 percent) were more trusting of robots over their managers. Singapore followed by 83 percent; Brazil, 78 percent; Japan, 76 percent; UAE, 74 percent; Australia/New Zealand, 58 percent; U.S., 57 percent; UK, 54 percent; and France, 56 percent.

5,2020-01-22,Digital Transformation in Manufacturing,"January 21, 2020
Manufacturers are in a difficult position. Digital transformation is sweeping the sector and the pressure is building to provide a frictionless buying experiences that encompass all available sales channels, including eCommerce. In order to retain share of wallet and increase loyalty, manufacturers must meet the increasing demands of buyers, a B2B buying experience that is as seamless as any B2C experience. But, the complexities of a B2B purchase, coupled with inflexible legacy backend systems, puts a strain on the entire manufacturing organization.
Offering an omni-channel experience
As the manufacturing industry moves toward Industry 4.0, many are seeing a shift with their customers from brand loyalty to experience loyalty. No longer is it enough to have the best price or a good relationship. Manufacturers must ensure they are keeping up with the changing needs of buyers and the technology advancements they desire by providing an adaptable omni-channel experience that can quickly be modified to adapt to the market and buyer demands.
Buyers now expect their professional purchasing experiences to closely match personal purchasing experiences. In fact, 1/3 of B2B buyers worldwide say their customer experience expectations have increased in the past year, according to a recent report. And, 20% of buyers have switched sellers due to a lack of integration across sales channels.
A true omni-channel experience allows for a transparent, consistent purchasing experience regardless of how customers are buying; online, through a salesperson, or in store. In addition, it is expected that contract pricing, purchase controls, net terms, and SKU level data be passed and adhered to across all channels. When a manufacturer can do this seamlessly, they will create deeper customer loyalty and increase share of wallet.
Bringing AR and AP teams together with technology
Nearly half of all B2B buyers said it takes at least two to three days to be onboarded by a seller before they can purchase online, a recent survey revealed. This is often happens when AR departments are not properly equipped to determine the creditworthiness and fraud risk of a buyer. Once the buyer is approved, a seller’s AP departments typically have specific requirements for the submission of invoices. With differing requirements from a multitude of buyers, the resulting time-consuming and manual processes slow down the onboarding process and increase the time to sale. This friction is compounded by the fact that most of the backend processes rely on dated technology and systems. For instance, a recent article found nearly 44% of invoices are still delivered via fax machine and roughly 72% arrive via postal mail. When AR and AP teams don’t communicate properly, it becomes an issue for sales teams as well and the customer experience. By switching to a payments process that relies less on manual work and more on digital enhancements, manufacturers are likely to see an increase in buyer satisfaction as well as a more efficient customer experience.
Completing a digital transformation not only strengthens the buyer-seller relationship, but it also creates a tighter bond between AR and AP teams — increasing productivity and efficiency on both sides. Implementing a technology that can evolve the traditional, paper-based process allows AR and AP teams to work in a smoother environment, cuts down the pressure on the manufacturer to beat competitors and marketplace goliaths, and ultimately leaves the end customer satisfied with the overall purchasing experience.
Conclusion
Today’s manufacturers are facing a major decision: Work toward a digital transformation or become obsolete. However, manufacturers don’t have to go it alone. MSTS’ Credit as a Service® (CaaS) solution helps manufacturers create a seamless onboarding process and an omni-channel purchasing experience for buyers.

6,2020-01-22,U.S. Manufacturing’s Not Only Decoupling from China,"January 21, 2020
The Commerce Department’s GDP-by-Industry series is almost always overlooked by followers of the economy, and partly that’s the Commerce Department’s fault. Its updates are invariably a quarter behind, so it’s what analysts call a (seriously) lagging indicator that says relatively little about the more important question of what’s in store.
Nonetheless, even when they’re lagging, distinctive and detailed indicators can clarify long-term trends considerably, and that’s why I like GDP-by-Industry and track it so closely. Because it sheds lots of light on some of the most important economic and trade-related issues of the day – and especially on the impact of President Trump’s tariff-heavy policies. Specifically, the latest set of figures, which were issued January 9, reveal that during the Trump administration, the United States has continued to progress toward the worthy goal of reducing domestic manufacturing’s dependence on imports (and especially imports from increasingly hostile countries like China) for acceptable levels of growth.
In other words, the People’s Republic isn’t the only country from which American manufacturing is decoupling.
According to the new data, the latest year-on-quarter results show that between the third quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019, U.S. manufacturing output (measured according to a gauge called gross value added) increased by 1.21 percent. That’s not much. But the manufacturing trade deficit during this period rose by only 2.55 percent. (Both figures are in pre-inflation dollars, because inflation-adjusted manufacturing trade figures aren’t available.)
Although this growth rate is lower than that achieved between the second quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2019 (2.03 percent), that figure was accompanied by a much faster increase in the manufacturing trade deficit (7.83 percent). The first quarter to first quarter results? Manufacturing production growth of 2.76 percent, and manufacturing trade deficit increase of 1.29 percent. That is, manufacturing output actually grew faster than the trade deficit. So from that standpoint, the third quarter result are disappointing.
They look even more disappointing when compared with the results from the first two years of the Trump administration. In 2017, manufacturing production also grew somewhat faster (3.99 percent) than the increase in manufacturing’s trade gap (3.16 percent), and in 2018, output grew much faster (6.23 percent to 3.96 percent).
These Trump presidency figures, in turn, have been much better than those reported for President Obama’s administration. Once the current economic recovery entered a normal phase (2011), the manufacturing trade deficit grew much faster than output ever year except for 2013.
So what’s the case for the latest third quarter 2018-third quarter 2019 figures representing continued progress? And why should anyone be happy with 1.21 percent annual manufacturing output growth no matter what’s happening on the trade deficit side?
Two answers suggest themselves. First, since the President began imposing tariffs in earnest (essentially, in April, 2018), importers have been “front-running” their purchases from abroad. Their efforts to secure these deals before various sets of tariffs kicked in has produced several short-term distortions in the trade deficit in particular. Second, since the spring, Boeing’s safety woes have exerted a major drag both on domestic manufacturing output and on industry’s trade performance – since the aircraft giant has long been America’s leading exporting company.
Just one example of the difference Boeing has made: Between the third quarters of 2018 and 2019, the U.S. civilian aircraft trade surplus dropped from just under $10 billion to just under $6.5 billion. Civilian aircraft is of course the product category containing Boeing’s troubled 737 Max jet, and the plane was grounded worldwide, or banned from many national airspaces, starting in March.
The relationship between trade balances and production is never one-to-one, especially over relatively short time frames. And the matter becomes more complicated in sectors like aircraft, with its long lead times and generally large backlogs. But it’s difficult to believe that the 737 Max crisis and the narrowing of the aircraft trade surplus hasn’t impacted American civilian aircraft production and exports at all. (In fact, between those two quarters civilian aircraft exports, which are strongly related to output levels, sank by $2.75 billion, or nearly 22 percent.)
Moreover, for the purposes of comparing manufacturing output growth and the manufacturing’s trade deficit growth, the aircraft troubles are significant. Had the category’s trade performance simply remained the same between the third quarters of 2018 and 2019, the trade shortfall would have increased not by 2.55 percent, but 1.25 percent – less than half the rate. As result, during that period, manufacturing’s output (1.21 percent) and trade deficit would have grown at very nearly the same pace.
What does the future hold for this key ratio? On the one hand, civilian aircraft production is bound to decrease for the foreseeable future due to the 737 Max production halt announced by Boeing in mid-December. On the other, numerous signs indicate that industry overall has come out of the recession that dogged it for much of the last year and a half (and that by some output measures, never happened at all). Moreover, the Phase One trade deal signed by the United States and China last week could well reduce at least some of the tariff-related uncertainty that’s clearly slowed manufacturing-heavy capital spending decisions by American business in general, and certainly in manufacturing itself.
That looks like a modest case for domestic manufacturing continuing its longer term trend of becoming more self-sufficient while growing adequately – a development that makes major sense in a world that’s far more uncertain.

7,2020-01-22,Importance of Transitional Planning,"National Center for the Middle Market (NCMM)
COLUMBUS, OH — New research from the National Center for the Middle Market (NCMM) finds that more than three-quarters of middle market businesses have either experienced a major transition in the past five years or expect one in the next five years. Far from being unusual, major transitions are business as usual: More than half (54 percent) experienced and expect to experience major transitions, often more than once in a given five-year period. Transitions studied included acquisitions, CEO succession, being acquired or taking on transformational new investment, and restructuring.
Preparing for Major Business Transition, a special report by the NCMM shows that the more companies prepare for transitions, the better results they get. While the vast majority — more than 90 percent — of well-prepared companies say their transitions were successful, only a third of less-well-prepared companies say the same. The study also reveals the importance of assembling a team of trusted advisors to help executives chart a path through transition.
“With baby boomers nearing retirement, an influx of private-equity funding, low interest rates and high valuations, we’re seeing a perfect storm of factors lining up for increased transitions in the near future,” said NCMM Executive Director Thomas A. Stewart. “If these companies prepare for their coming transitions, their results can lead to strong positive outcomes.”
The report, based on results of a survey conducted by NCMM in collaboration with SunTrust Banks (now Truist) and Chubb, polled 404 middle market leaders with active responsibility for strategic decision making. The survey was fielded in November 2019.
“Middle market companies have much to gain from a comprehensive approach to transition planning,” said NCMM Managing Director Doug Farren. “By learning from our key insights, including the importance of trusted advisors and the keys to succession planning, executives can set their companies up for success now and into the future.”
About the National Center for the Middle Market (NCMM)

8,2020-01-22,Lighthouses Revitalize U.S. Manufacturing,"World Economic Forum’s Global Lighthouse Network helps manufacturing industry catch up to rest of the world in adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution technology.
January 18, 2020
By Isabel Yang, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President, Advanced Energy
The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought significant advancements to nearly every sector of society, dramatically changing the way we live, how we work and what we produce. Particularly as consumers benefit from IoT technologies enabling the evolution of semi-autonomous vehicles, smart homes, voice assistants and fitness trackers. We cannot overlook the fact that IoT is also driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0).
At the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in 2018, top advisors from the private and public sector set out to identify manufacturing’s transformation leaders who are frontrunners charting a new course and paving the way. What followed was a 2019 white paper in which 16 geographically diverse companies are starting to reap the rewards of IIoT as early adopters. In todays fast changing world of digital disruption, early adopters not only gains markets advantage, but in some cases becomes winner takes all. These 16 companies, presented as “Lighthouses,” exhibited all of the essential characteristics of Industry 4.0 but also reflected the globalization of industrial manufacturing and the opportunities available for factories of all sizes anywhere on the planet.
Innovation in manufacturing is critically important considering its prominence in the world’s economies. According to research from Brookings, China leads with over $2.01 trillion in output, which accounts for 27 percent of China’s overall national output and 20 percent of the world’s manufacturing output. The United States is second at $1.867 trillion, representing 12 percent of the nation’s output and 18 percent of the world’s capacity. In terms of employment, Poland leads with 20.2 percent of its workers engaged in manufacturing, followed by Germany (19 percent), Italy (18.5 percent), Turkey (18.1 percent), South Korea (16.9 percent), China (16.9 percent) and Japan (16.9 percent). With statistics like those, it’s fair to say stakes are high. Here in America, where approximately 10.5 percent of the workforce is employed in manufacturing, a report from McKinsey suggests that, by upgrading plants and equipment with Industrial IoT (IIoT) technologies, the U.S. has the potential of raising manufacturing GDP by more than $500 billion annually.
The Industrial IoT (IIoT) connecting a network of machines and sensors that communicate with each other and humans will undoubtedly transform every aspect of production, from the plant floor to the end user experience. Witnessed by the success of the lighthouse factories, these new digital technologies and automated processes are tangibly demonstrating their ability to drive productivity and reduce human error. More automation, however, requires more power. And, at the core, it is the consistent, specific and reliable energy supplies that provide the lifeblood of the smart factory. Even brief aberrations or voltage sags can create a domino effect of detrimental consequences. Voltage sags, or dips, are the most common events affecting power quality—and costly. Smart factories with robots and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) for controlling motors, pumps, lights, fans, circuit breakers and other machinery, are more vulnerable to voltage sags as equipment complexity increases.
Monitoring and controlling temperature is also one of the highest costs for manufacturers. Inaccurate low and high operating temperatures can result in product failure, premature machine failure, unexpected shutdowns and in rare circumstances equipment meltdowns and fires. Thermal control is critical the production of steel, glass, plastics, coatings and plasma, which is ubiquitous in the electronics industry with flat panel displays such as televisions and computers. As display sizes and resolution increase, the negative financial impact of film defects is magnified, putting extreme demands on equipment suppliers. Additionally, rapid change and process interruptions require manufacturing equipment to be increasingly flexible and reliable. Minimizing arc energy while maintaining a stable, repeatable process helps in achieving higher film quality, increasing yields and reducing manufacturing costs. This requires tight performance parameters, customizable power delivery, precision pulsing and multi-level arc management to enable process stability and control. Such solutions offer the kind of consistent energy flow necessary for today’s most advanced machines and sensors powering smart factories.
In our industry, which includes manufacturing semiconductor and industrial glass coatings among other things, innovation has been a top priority at home in the U.S. and abroad, where Advanced Energy (AE) continues to bring highly engineered, precision power conversion, measurement and control solutions to help customers worldwide with their mission-critical applications and processes. Our new facility in Caesarea, Israel underscores that commitment. The new 6,500 square-foot facility includes business offices and a state-of-the-art R&D lab that advances AE’s goal to provide customers in the semiconductor, medical, defense and industrial markets with the most reliable, smart technologies and resources. The inclusion of an on-site services and repair facility will also help to support AE’s regional customers, who increasingly require access to high-quality local service for their power systems and controls.
Industry 4.0 is essential to breaking out of productivity stagnation—and designing a resilient smart IoT-enabled power supply is an essential part of manufacturing’s digital transformation. With higher power consumption inevitable, factories must be proactive in addressing power management, as well as energy efficiency goals, thermal impact and the need for improved reliability and safety. This is no easy task, but with lighthouses paving the way, the U.S. manufacturing industry can initiate a profound shift that impacts every aspect of modern society.

9,2020-01-22,Nestlé to offer Starbucks experience in the home with new product line-up,"American coffeehouse chain, Starbucks, and Swiss food and drink company, Nestlé, have strengthened their ongoing collaboration further with today’s launch of new coffee products under the Starbucks brand.
The new range includes: Fresh Brew coffee, Cold Brew concentrate; and Starbucks coffee blends containing golden turmeric and essential vitamins among others. This range allows consumers to satiate their cravings for Starbucks coffee even at home.
The new line-up will be available in US grocery stores nationwide from February 2020.
The new offerings come as part of a $7.1 billion global alliance signed by Nestlé and Starbucks’ 2018. Through the deal, Nestlé has acquired a global license to produce Starbucks-branded products, including ground and roast coffee, as well as portioned and soluble coffee, teas and creamers. However, the arrangement excludes sales of any products – produced as part of the agreement – at any Starbucks outlet. Nestle also took on around 500 Starbucks employees as part of the deal.
The deal kick-started with the duo’s launch of a new line-up in February 2019. The range included 24 products, such as single-origin coffees, signature Starbucks blends and classic preparations like Cappuccino and caramel macchiato, all made using 100% ethically sourced Arabica beans.
The range also marked the debut of Starbucks capsules, which have been developed using Nestlé’s proprietary Nescafé Dolce Gusto and Nespresso technologies.
The partnership is strategically important for both companies which have come together to create a stronger collaboration in the highly fragmented consumer beverages market. The market is seeing a slew of new entrants and an increasing number of mergers, acquisitions and alliances aimed at taking over a bigger share of the global coffee market that is expected to be worth $102.28 billion by 2023.
Transactions such as Coca Cola’s acquisition of Costa and JAB Holdings’ expansion of its coffee portfolio, which included the acquisition of Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Keurig Green Mountain, Caribou Coffee, Jacobs Douwe Egberts and several others, emphasise the growing focus of investors in the coffee segment and the rapid consolidation of the segment.
The coffee market is predicted to undergo significant growth, bolstered by changing urban lifestyle habits, increasing demand for on-the-go food and beverages and increasing customer purchasing power.
Nestle’s Chief Executive Mark Schneider has already identified coffee as a strategic category for investment and the company’s latest developments, including its acquisition of a majority stake in Blue Bottle Coffee, purchase of Texas-based Chameleon Cold-Brew and even the Starbucks deal, all indicate that the Swiss company is well on track to emerge as the top player in the coffee market.",https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/nestle-offer-starbucks-experience-home-new-product-line/,empty
10,2020-01-22,New-found method could simplify aerospace-grade composite manufacturing,"A new method using carbon nanotubes to create aerospace-grade composites without an autoclave has been developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
The new process, which could revolutionise aerospace manufacturing, doesn’t require pressure vessels and huge ovens, which are currently used in the manufacture of airplane primary structures.
The research team included: Brian Wardle, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT; Jeonyoo Lee, a postdoctoral student at the MIT; and Seth Kessler, President and CEO of Metis Design Corporation, a Boston, Massachusetts-based aerospace structural health monitoring company.
Using existing techniques the production of an aeroplane’s main body involves multiple sheets of several composite materials, which are arranged and moulded into the shape of a fuselage and put into gigantic ovens and autoclaves in which those layers are fused together to form a strong and tough aerodynamic shell.
Wardle says, “If you’re making a primary structure like a fuselage or wing, you need to build a pressure vessel, or autoclave sometimes the size of a three-story building, which itself requires time and money to pressurise. These things are massive pieces of infrastructure. We are working towards making primary structure materials without autoclave pressure, so we can get rid of all that infrastructure.”
In 2015, Lee led the team, along with another member of Wardle’s lab, in creating a method to make aerospace-grade composites without requiring an oven to fuse the materials together. Instead of placing layers of material inside an oven to cure, the researchers essentially wrapped the materials in an ultrathin film of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
When they applied an electric current to the film, the CNTs (picture a nanoscale electric blanket), quickly generated heat, causing the materials within to cure and fuse together.
That method, known as “out-of-oven” (or OoO), produced composites that were as strong as the materials made in conventional aeroplane manufacturing ovens, by using just 1% of the energy.
Removing the need for an autoclave altogether
The team’s next step was to look for ways to manufacture high-performance composites without the use of large, high-pressure autoclaves that create high amount of pressure to press materials together, squeezing out any voids, or air pockets.
Previous research by Spirit AeroSystems working in collaboration with the University of Strathclyde helped develop a manufacturing process that didn’t use an autoclave but instead a multi-zone heated tool with advanced control to tailor the curing cycle time to match individual part geometries.
Other researchers including Wardle’s group have also explored “out-of-autoclave,” or OoA, techniques to manufacture composites without using the huge machines. But most of these techniques produced composites where nearly 1% of the produced materials contained voids, which can compromise a material’s strength and lifetime. In comparison, aerospace-grade composites made in autoclaves are of such high quality that any voids they contain are neglible and not easily measured.
“The problem with these OoA approaches is also that the materials have been specially formulated, and none are qualified for primary structures such as wings and fuselages,” Wardle says. “They’re making some inroads in secondary structures, such as flaps and doors, but they still get voids.”
A new solution to out-of-autoclave
Part of Wardle’s latest work focuses on developing nanoporous networks — ultrathin films made from aligned, microscopic material such as carbon nanotubes, that can be engineered with exceptional properties, including color, strength, and electrical capacity.
The researchers investigated whether the nanoporous films could be used in place of giant autoclaves to squeeze out voids between two material layers, as unlikely as that may seem.
The researchers proposed that if a thin film of carbon nanotubes were sandwiched between two materials, then, as the materials were heated and softened, the capillaries between the carbon nanotubes should have a surface energy and geometry such that they would draw the materials in toward each other, rather than leaving a void between them. Lee calculated that the capillary pressure should be larger than the pressure applied by the autoclaves.
The researchers tested this concept by growing films of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, then laying the films between layers of materials that are typically used in the autoclave-based manufacturing of primary aircraft structures. The researchers wrapped the layers in a second film of carbon nanotubes, which they applied an electric current to, in order to to heat it up. They observed that as the materials heated and softened in response, they were pulled into the capillaries of the intermediate CNT film.
The resulting composite lacked voids, similar to aerospace-grade composites that are produced in an autoclave. The researchers subjected the composites to strength tests, attempting to push the layers apart, the idea being that voids, if present, would allow the layers to separate more easily.
“In these tests, we found that our out-of-autoclave composite was just as strong as the gold-standard autoclave process composite used for primary aerospace structures,” Wardle says.
The team will next look for ways to scale up the pressure-generating CNT film. In their experiments, they worked with samples measuring several centimeters wide — large enough to demonstrate that nanoporous networks can pressurize materials and prevent voids from forming. To make this process viable for manufacturing entire wings and fuselages, researchers will have to find ways to manufacture CNT and other nanoporous films at a much larger scale.
“There are ways to make really large blankets of this stuff, and there’s continuous production of sheets, yarns, and rolls of material that can be incorporated in the process,” Wardle says.
He plans also to explore different formulations of nanoporous films, engineering capillaries of varying surface energies and geometries, to be able to pressurize and bond other high-performance materials.
“Now we have this new material solution that can provide on-demand pressure where you need it,” Wardle says. “Beyond airplanes, most of the composite production in the world is composite pipes, for water, gas, oil, all the things that go in and out of our lives. This could make making all those things, without the oven and autoclave infrastructure.”

11,2020-01-22,Honda and Isuzu to test fuel cell-powered heavy-duty trucks,"Honda and Isuzu have collaborated to conduct a joint research project where they will use hydrogen fuel cells to power heavy-duty trucks.
The Japanese automotive manufacturers, which are aiming to expand the use of fuel cells to apply zero-emission technology to larger vehicles, will be sharing their technological expertise under a two-year official contract.
Under the agreement, Honda’s expertise in developing fuel cell systems will be combined with Isuzu’s specialty in building heavy-duty trucks. The latter’s intention to test Honda’s fuel cell drive train in its commercial vehicles would expand the scope for the entire automotive industry, as the technology could be used in a wide range of vehicles in the future.
This is the first time that Honda has given an ‘outsider’ access to its fuel cell technology.
Importance of hydrogen for commercial vehicles
Speaking with reporters, a Honda spokesperson said: “Although we have done extensive R&D into passenger FCVs (fuel cell vehicles), we have not been able to study how best to apply the technology to commercial vehicles. This partnership will allow us to do that.”
Isuzu has been endorsing the use of low-carbon and sustainable energy for quite some time. To achieve that goal, the company has been researching and developing different powertrains, such as clean diesel engines, engines for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) and electric vehicles (EV) powertrains. Similarly, Honda has been putting efforts to promote carbon-free society and thus has been involved in researching and developing FCVs for over three decades.
Vehicles running on hydrogen fuel cells have been lauded as an ultimate eco-friendly transport owing to their absolute zero greenhouse emissions and typically providing greater mileage and faster refuelling than EVs. However, the lack of proper refuelling infrastructure has greatly restrained the adoption of these vehicles.
As global emissions regulations have continued to tighten every year, automobile companies are developing a greater number of EVs. Most industry experts perceive EVs as the answer for passenger cars in city areas, but hydrogen fuel cells are often touted as an efficient solution for longer journeys and to power large vehicles like buses and trucks.
The global market for hydrogen autos totalled only about 4,000 vehicles in 2018, compared with 1.4 million EVs sold in the same year.",https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/honda-isuzu-test-fuel-cell-powered-heavy-duty-trucks/,empty

13,2020-01-21,Plugin vulnerability finders tell WordPress users to update asap,"Three WordPress plugins have been picking up quite the glare of attention this month after researchers found serious vulnerabilities in them—and the numbers are sobering, in that these plugins have been installed on more than 400,000 websites—with users too wide open for cyberattacks to ignore.
The three plugins in the spotlight were InfiniteWP, WP Time Capsule, and WP Database Reset plugins.
ZDNet was one of the tech watching sites to prod readers to action: ""If you use these plugins you should update immediately as firewall l protection will not work.""
HotHardware's Brittany Goetting offered some more grim numbers. There are over 50,000 plugins to go round and not all are created equal, she wrote.
Out of the three in the spotlight, one may as well begin with the authentication bypass vulnerability in the InfiniteWP Client. Naked Security described it as a tool that allows admins to manage multiple WordPress sites from the same interface.
Administrators overseeing sites use InfiniteWP Client.
At least 300,000 of sites could have been affected by the vulnerability, Goetting said.
The plugin, it was found, lacked certain authorization checks. ""You are vulnerable if you are using InfiniteWP Client versions up to 1.9.4.4, and as a result users of the plugin should update their sites to version 1.9.4.5 as soon as possible,"" she wrote.
The Wordfence blog (Wordfence is product of a company called Defiant) said this was a critical authentication vulnerability. ""A proof of concept was published this morning, January 14, 2020. If you are using InfiniteWP client version 1.9.4.4 or earlier we recommend immediately updating your installation to protect your site.""
Dan Goodin in Ars Technica also described the seriousness of the authentication bypass vulnerability in InfiniteWP Client plugin.
""It allows administrators to manage multiple websites from a single server. The flaw lets anyone log in to an administrative account with no credentials at all. From there, attackers can delete contents, add new accounts, and carry out a wide range of other malicious tasks.""
Security company WebARX reported InfiniteWP Client, and another vulnerability, WP Time Capsule.
The WP Time Capsule was designed to make backing up website data easier.
Ars Technica reported that the bug had been fixed in version 1.21.16. ""Sites running earlier versions should update right away. Web security firm WebARX has more details."" said Ars.
ZDNet talked about WP Time Capsule; Charlie Osborne in ZDNet said that WP Time Capsule was active on at least 20,000 domains, according to the WordPress plugins library.
The WP Database Reset plugin received much attention, with nearly 80,000 sites using the plugin, which helps users to reset their databases or parts of databases to their default settings.
Wordfence: ""On January 7th, our threat Intelligence team discovered vulnerabilities in WP Database Reset, a WordPress plugin installed on over 80,000 websites. One of these flaws allowed any unauthenticated user to reset any table from the database to the initial WordPress set-up state, while the other flaw allowed any authenticated user, even those with minimal permissions, the ability to grant their account administrative privileges while dropping all other users from the table with a simple request.""
The plugin did not initially include the proper security checks. ""One vulnerability allowed attackers to reset any table and cause a loss of data availability,"" wrote Goetting. ""Another vulnerability enabled any subscriber to take full control of the website and kick out all administrators. Both flaws have thankfully been fixed with version 3.15. Of course the security researchers also encourage users to always back up their sites.""
Sergiu Gartlan for BleepingComputer paid attention to that finding too. ""Critical bugs found in the WordPress Database Reset plugin ...allow attackers to drop all users and get automatically elevated to an administrator role and to reset any table in the database.""
The Wordfence blog issued this advice, seeing that these were considered critical security issues that could cause complete site reset and/or takeover. ""We highly recommend updating to the latest version (3.15) immediately.""
What did Ars Technica conclude about the three plugins, InfiniteWP, WP Time Capsule, and WP Database Reset? They had few words and these came easily: ""It's time to patch.""
Readers' comments in Ars were attempting to pinpoint the source of the problems. ""The problem,"" said one reader, ""is when site admins install 10,000 plugins, each of which becomes a new vector for attack.""
Where did users hear that before? Computer Business Review, back in June, declared that ""WordPress Plugins are widely regarded to be one of the single greatest security threats to WordPress users.""
There's no evidence that any of the three vulnerable plugins are being actively exploited in the wild, said Goodin.

14,2020-01-21,Manufacturer Faces Phishing Attack,"CEO fraud is creating massive headaches. The scary part is you don’t even need to be hacked for this fraud to be carried out.
Credential Phishing Leads to Inbox Infiltration
The scam all began when the CEO fell for a credential phishing email. Credential phishing emails are used by malicious actors to try and trick individuals into voluntarily handing over their login details, typically by directing them to a link that takes them through to a fake login page. In this case, the CEO received an email from what he thought was Microsoft. The email stated that his account details needed to be validated in order for him to continue to use the Outlook service without disruption. As the email appeared to have come from an official source, the CEO clicked on the link. The link took him through to a seemingly legitimate landing page, where he inputted his email login details. Assuming that his account had been validated, the CEO gave no further thought to the incident.
However, by inputting his credentials on this login page, he had actually passed on his details to a fraudster who could now access his account. Gaining access to the CEO’s email account allowed the fraudster to gather valuable information about how invoice payments were processed at this company. For example, it allowed the fraudster to take a look at previous invoices that had been sent from the insured’s contract manufacturers and suppliers and to identify the main individual in the insured’s finance department responsible for paying invoices and authorizing wire transfer requests. What’s more, it also allowed the fraudster to gain access to the CEO’s Outlook calendar and establish what the CEO would be doing on any given work day.
Having worked out the CEO’s schedule from his calendar, the fraudster waited until the CEO was travelling abroad for a few weeks on a business trip. With the CEO out of the office and with the chances of the scam being uncovered much reduced, the fraudster chose this moment to strike.
The fraudster’s plan involved posing as a member of the accounts department for one of the insured’s contract manufacturers.
The fraudster’s first step was to set up forwarding rules in the CEO’s email account. Forwarding rules are settings that can be applied to an email account which ensure that emails that fall within a certain criteria are automatically forwarded to a specific folder or to another email account. In this case, the fraudster set up two rules to ensure that the CEO didn’t come across any of the emails related to the scam while he was away on business. The first rule that was created meant that any emails from the individual responsible for approving payments were immediately marked as read and sent directly into the account’s deleted items folder.
The second rule meant that any email that included a keyword, such as “invoice” or words used in this particular contract manufacturer’s trading name, in the subject line was marked as read and automatically sent to the deleted items folder.
Phony Invoices Lead to Unrecoverable Funds
With the background work now done, the fraudster sent an email to the CEO purporting to be from the accounts department of the contract manufacturer, attaching an invoice for $47,500 and explaining that there had been a change of account details. To add an air of authenticity to the scam, the fraudster used one of the actual contract manufacturer’s invoices as a template. So to all intents and purposes the invoice looked normal; it featured the contract manufacturer’s logo and address on the heading of the invoice and carried a breakdown of the work carried out. The only difference was that the account details had been altered by the fraudster.
As a result of the forwarding rules in place, this email was immediately marked as read and sent to the deleted items folder. The fraudster then logged into the CEO’s account and, posing as the CEO, forwarded this email to the individual within the finance department responsible for authorizing payments and requested that the payment be made that day.
As the CEO was out of the office and because the email requesting that the invoice be paid had come from his account, the employee in the finance department assumed that this was a legitimate request and paid the invoice.
Having seen that this ruse had worked, the fraudster decided to try their luck and sent through another invoice a few days later. On this occasion, due to the fact that it had only been a few days since the last invoice had been paid, the employee in the finance department responded to the CEO about the request to check that this was correct. Because of the forwarding rules put in place, however, the CEO was oblivious to the employee’s response – only the fraudster was aware of it. In the guise of the CEO, the fraudster responded and explained that all was in order and that the invoice should be paid.
With the employee in the finance department genuinely believing that they were in correspondence with the CEO and with any objections and queries about the payments being swiftly answered, the fraudster managed to get two further invoices approved, bringing the total amount paid out to $190,000.
It was only upon the CEO’s return to the office that the payments came up in discussion and the scam was uncovered. Our policyholder reported the incident to local law enforcement and attempted to recover the funds from the recipient bank, but all of the money had been moved out of the fraudulent account and the prospects of a successful recovery were deemed to be remote.
Thankfully the firm had purchased comprehensive cybercrime cover as part of their cyber insurance policy and were able to recover the loss in full.
Our Best Defence Against The Rise In CEO Fraud
This claim highlights a few key points. Firstly, it illustrates how CEOs and senior executives are prime targets for cybercriminals. CEOs and senior executives usually act as the face of their respective companies and as a result they tend to have bigger profiles on company websites and social media accounts, allowing cybercriminals to gather valuable information about them. In addition, cybercriminals know that employees are instinctively less likely to question and more likely to act upon instructions from senior executives. CEOs and senior executives therefore need to be especially conscious of sticking to good cybersecurity practices, and employees need to be particularly alert to suspicious emails from senior executives and have robust call-back and authentication procedures in place.
Secondly, it shows that cybercriminals are becoming much more sophisticated. In the past, it was not uncommon to see blatant attempts at funds transfer fraud over email, with an urgent appeal for help or bogus prize giveaways being just two examples. Now, however, we are seeing far more nuanced attacks. In this case, the fraudster managed to trick the CEO into volunteering his email login details, identify who was responsible for authorizing payments, and work out when the CEO was out of the office on a business trip. They also set up forwarding rules in the CEO’s inbox to avoid detection and made use of one of the company’s genuine contract manufacturer’s invoice templates to add authenticity to the scam.
Finally, this claim also busts a common myth – that by investing heavily in IT security, there’s no need for cyber insurance.
The fact is that the vast majority of cyber incidents are a result of human error. With increasingly sophisticated attacks like this on the rise, it makes it very difficult for employees to tell the difference between a real email and a fake email or a real invoice and a fake invoice. Furthermore, with more and more financial transactions being carried out electronically, the number of opportunities for cybercriminals to steal these funds has never been greater. Having good training and authentication procedures in place can certainly help reduce the risk of an event like this happening, but it’s impossible for any business to be completely impervious to these kinds of attacks. Cyber insurance serves as a valuable safety net should the worst happen.

15,2020-01-21,Rapid Technology Advancements in Manufacturing,"From product research and development, quality assurance, and everything in between, technological advancements are changing the manufacturing process.
Blockchain technology is improving supply chain management. Artificial intelligence and The Internet of Things (IoT) is completely transforming quality control processes with automation and remote monitoring. Drones have the capability to help monitor manufacturing plant operations and maintenance activities. Robotic and Computer Controlled machinery have become ubiquitous and are now responsible for many of the tasks and operations previously handled by employees. According to the Brookings Institution, there are likely more than 1.9 million robots in use in manufacturing facilities and warehouses across the globe; with roughly 240,000 in North America.
Wearable technology for employees exists which can signal automated equipment to shut down when an employee gets too close to a process that could result in employee injury. This technology reduces the risk of people getting injured in those situations where workers are operating machinery and equipment manually. In addition, technology applications are introducing new areas of risk that require manufacturers to conduct new and different hazard analyses on systems that are interconnected, impact the supply chain, and could create a process disruption.
As a result of these significant changes and advances, risk management practices and insurance coverages must be reassessed and updated to keep up with the evolving risks that inevitably come with the continued adoption of new capabilities.
The implementation of technology into manufacturing is unlikely to slow and, in fact, it is expected that the pace will accelerate. Therefore, reassessing and updating insurance coverages and risk management means that manufacturers are strongly encouraged to evaluate and update their insurance programs and risk management processes on an ongoing basis. Three ways they can do this are:
1. Augment property insurance with cyber coverage
Whenever a new piece of network-connected technology is brought on line in a manufacturing plant, cyber security risks are inherently introduced. Today, many of the advancements reshaping assembly lines are remote controlled by an internet-connected piece of technology. Whenever any equipment is connected to a network, it gives cybercriminals a potential pathway to hack their way in. Traditionally, cyber security concerns centered around data security and compromised sensitive personal information. But today, cyber criminals are also able to gain control of mission-critical equipment, sabotage production, damage machinery, and even harm employees.
The financial implications of such a cybersecurity breach can be devastating. Most property insurance does not cover damages that result from a cybersecurity event. While many manufacturers are beginning to purchase cyber coverage, many companies have not yet studied the potential implications of a cyber event and are exposed to significant financial loss and business interruption. Company owners and operators should also assess the cybersecurity infrastructure at their third-party vendors. If vulnerabilities exist at these companies, it is critical that the manufacturer ensure their contracts are structured to protect them from liability in the event of a breach.
2. Address rapidly rising equipment replacement and repair costs
The technology being deployed in manufacturing facilities is far more expensive to repair and replace than traditional machinery. Advanced manufacturing equipment is often custom made for a particular facility and repairing or replacing such a piece of equipment can take months and introduce costly production interruptions and delays. Plant owners and operators must take this into account when developing their property values and business interruption estimates for property and equipment breakdown insurance purposes. It is important that your policies include replacement cost valuation where appropriate, no coinsurance requirements (if available and at a reasonable premium), a sufficient period of indemnity for business interruption, extra expense coverage, and blanket limits where possible.
3. Update risk management practices to match changing worker dynamics
Technology is changing the way manufacturing workers do their jobs. Traditionally, manufacturing was very labor intensive, but technology advancements are increasingly taking these workers off the floor and out of harm’s way. By reducing human interaction and worker fatigue, this should reduce the risk for injuries and accidents. With fewer workplace injuries, not only can the cost of workers compensation be reduced, but all of the hidden costs that accompany employee related injuries should also be reduced. It should also be noted that in many cases, the workers compensation class codes for an insured may not have been updated to address the changes in job descriptions and activities resulting from process advancements. It is a good practice to periodically review this with your broker and carrier as your manufacturing process continues to change and evolve.
On the other hand, new technology can introduce new risks that must be addressed. Manufacturers must refresh their risk management approach and risk assessment strategies to reflect this new operating environment. Standard Operating Procedures must be reviewed and updated on a frequent basis. In addition to hazard assessments on new equipment, it is important to understand how a piece of advanced manufacturing machinery can affect the entire process in the event of an un-planned shut down. Programming glitches, system failures, and breaches of the cyber environment can all have a devastating impact on a company. Table top exercises and testing of a business continuity plan are useful and can prepare a company to better manage a disruption. In addition, property and cyber underwriters have come to expect their insureds to have risk mitigation and continuity programs in place in order to provide insurance coverage at a competitive premium.
Keeping up with new technology
As with many other industries, technology is rapidly transforming the manufacturing segment. As a result, insurance coverages and risk management strategies must be updated to reflect the rapid advancements and the new risks they present. Insurance brokers that have experience in this industry and knowledge of the nuances of these dynamics can help ensure that a manufacturer has the proper coverages and procedures in place. Investing some time and attention today can save plant owners and operators from incurring significant financial setbacks and production delays in the future.

By Peter Rifken, senior solutions consultant, Quick Base
Is your company defined by slim profit margins and the need to deliver quality products on strict deadlines? While these standards are the norm in the manufacturing industry, they are also difficult to live up to.
Thankfully, digital technology tools don’t have to be a dip in the road to world-class status. Smart investments and a will to change can transform dinosaur-era machinery and processes into a cutting-edge, company-wide system that is the envy of the industry.
Ok, so that sounds good, but what do you need to do to get there?
The answer starts with implementing tools to better capture available data and break down silos, streamlining communication across an organization.
A Proactive Approach to Data
As far as industries go, manufacturing is more numbers driven than most. That mindset spills over into companies’ ultra-defined KPIs, measurements and goals, whether it be parts per year, dollars saved, energy costs, etc. But more than others, this industry struggles to deliver effective, consistent results against their goals.
Why? For one, many manufacturers lack a centralized system to view relevant data. Without these capabilities, decision makers, both in the boardroom and on the warehouse floor, cannot dig deep into that data and understand what is preventing them from hitting target goals.
Certain data visualization tools allow manufacturers to see trends but don’t provide access to the database to see where a malfunction occurred. Let alone a tool to share that solution with teams across departments to scale the fix’s impact. Companies need nimble digital solutions that enable agility and flexibility, like filtering to view data that is most relevant to a given project.
With digital technology and the right tools, manufacturer leadership can empower employees to dig deeper into data and track the root cause of problems that contribute to hidden costs, and take action to create programs and initiatives to manage the continuous improvement process, moving the mindset needle from reactive to proactive.
Organizational Silos – A Strategic Roadblock
Silos are not a unique problem in modern business – but they are especially pervasive and detrimental in the manufacturing industry. That’s in large part because manufacturing companies are geographically spread out with disconnected operations. While they may be unified by a name and brand, these companies’ plants and departments are burdened by silos, with no digital tools to share useful information company-wide that can reduce rework costs.
Further, communication breakdowns can often be attributed to silos as it becomes difficult to disseminate lessons learned to a broader swath of employees — leading to duplicate work, inefficiencies, and increased costs.
The best way to break down silos is by providing and implementing better tools for sharing information across companies’ digital infrastructure. And yet most available communication solutions struggle to keep up with the pace of change that is required to realize integrated work environments.
However, there are cloud-based application development platforms that allow anyone to create, integrate and run business software applications and are tailored to the way their organizations work. This allows for both standardized processes and flexibility in a fast-paced world, freeing up time for leadership to think more strategically.
What Else Is Holding You Back?
Manufacturing industry challenges have been further amplified by the growing skills gap in the midst of one of the tightest labor markets in the country’s history. There are simply not enough prospective qualified employees for all of the available jobs on the market. A 2018 Deloitte study on challenges within manufacturing found that the skills gap may leave about 2.4 million positions unfilled by 2028. That’s not a great outlook for the coming decade.
But digital technology and cloud-based application tools can help bridge the labor gap by making companies more efficient – instituting processes to make employees’ jobs easier and more efficient. Emulating and aspiring to be a world-class company requires differentiated and innovative thinking, which is only possible with the right digital technology to identify and resolve issues and then deploying that solution to every other scenario across multiple plants or wherever else the same issue exists.
Technology has always been at the heart of the manufacturing industry. Finding a parity between older technology that still powers the brawn of the industry and the brain of the digital technologies powering the future of businesses is essential to walk the path to innovation and leadership.

17,2020-01-21,The Manufacturer: Top 10 features of 2019,"At The Manufacturer, we’re fortunate enough to visit many of the world-leading factories the UK has to offer, as well as speaking to a host of industry experts about the various challenges and triumphs they’ve experienced.
The past 12 months we no exception. We spoke with business leaders and researchers working in Formula One, technology, training, supply chain, steel, agriculture, textiles and the catapult network, to name just a few – as well as all those who shared their experiences and knowledge during Manufacturing Leaders’ Summit 2019.
Here are The Manufacturer’s most read, shared and referenced features of 2019.
The high-octane world of Formula One isn’t as far removed from the more traditional field of manufacturing as you might think. In fact, the two share several key similarities beyond the obvious.
Manufacturers and race teams are both trying to make sense of an ever-increasing volume of data and how that changes the way they behave.
Both are also having to make case-by-case business judgements on a growing list of potential technology investments, while simultaneously trying to minimise disruption to their operation and their employees and maximise the opportunities.
We explore how these three themes – data, technology and people – are impacting Formula One as well as the manufacturing sector more broadly.
The leaders of seven manufacturing businesses gathered last year to discuss the challenges faced by SMEs and the external support they use, or have used, to achieve their growth ambitions. The key takeaways of which were exclusively shared with The Manufacturer.
The discussion was loosely structured around a handful of open questions, with each manufacturing business represented being well-established (more than 10 years old), an international exporter, employing 46 -260 employees, and turning over £1.4m – £10m.
For the past four decades, every study and piece of research shows that we aren’t producing anywhere close to the number of skilled engineers and technicians we need.
Our frustrating lack of progress to this perennial issue is making the lives of industrial business owners even more difficult, as anyone who’s spent longer than 60 seconds with one of them will no doubt have been made aware.
To stimulate an adequate supply of trained engineers into industry, we need to radically change the way we teach, train and develop people at every stage of their lives. A new study proposes such a vision and offers a roadmap for how to get there.
How do you summarise the takeaways from 186 interactive roundtable discussions, more than a dozen keynote talks, two panel discussions and countless conversations at the coffee station? Here are our own highlights from the two days.
A fundamental realignment of manufacturing in the UK is on the cards, now the shape of a post-Brexit trading arrangement with the EU is becoming clearer.
A key part of that will be the reshoring of production back to the UK from what were once cheaper overseas factories.
Nick Peters reports on one UK-based component manufacturer, Albert Jagger Engineering, that is already ahead of the game.
The tenth National Manufacturing Debate, hosted by Cranfield University, brought together industry and academia to discuss one of the biggest challenges facing businesses – the digitalisation of supply chains.
Now more than ever, manufacturing relies on ever more sophisticated and complex global networks of suppliers, partners and customers. These networks are no longer linear chains, but circular ecosystems built on collaboration, innovation, resilience and – increasingly – digital technologies.
But what about the UK. How ready are our businesses for this transformation?
So, you’ve successfully embarked on a digital transformation journey. Your activities are aligned in support of your existing business strategy and they sensibly focus – at least initially – on driving internal productivity growth.
But where do you go next? If you’re wrestling with that exact question, then you’re not alone.
Vertical farming is by no means a new concept – the theory that food can be grown in large quantities inside tall buildings has been around for decades, but it is only recently that it has become possible at a price point that matches that of produce grown using traditional methods.
And it is all made possible by data lean manufacturing, and the same digital technologies that are revolutionising our factories.
Many women we speak to mention that a career in industry was never their first choice. However, once in the sector they can’t imagine doing anything else.
One such individual is Barbara Evans, a 25-year veteran of the steel industry.
We spoke to the competence assessor at Tata Steel in South Wales about the career she entered “by accident” more than two decades ago, and about the fact that there are “absolutely” opportunities for women in the traditionally male-dominated steel sector.
According to the British Fashion Council, the value of the fashion industry to the UK’s economy has increased to a record £32bn.
Textile manufacturers can take credit for a sizeable part of this growth, thanks to a welcome (if gradual) renaissance in British garment making across the UK.
We paid a visit to Jenny Holloway, CEO of London-based Fashion Enter, a business proving that clothes can be successfully made in volume in the UK and is part of the country-wide rebirth in British garment manufacturing.",https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/manufacturer-top-10-features-2019/,empty
18,2020-01-20,Balluff debuts wafer mapping sensor for small spaces,"Balluff’s new wafer mapping sensor, BOH00EZ, uses a precise photoelectric sensor for quick and reliable detection of semiconductor wafers and slotting errors in FOUPS – front opening unified pods.
Especially designed for use with extremely thin end effectors, it features a controlled and focused light spot, allowing it to detect wafers even just a few μm thick with extreme precision.
Based on photoelectric Micromote technology, it features the smallest LED sensor on the market in a small sensor head – measuring just 2.4 x 1.5 x 7 mm. This allows it to deliver precision in even the smallest spaces.
In addition to wafer mapping, this sensor delivers capabilities that can be used for a variety of applications that require through beam sensors in a small area, such as life science and food and beverage applications.",https://www.automationmag.com/balluff-debuts-wafer-mapping-sensor-for-small-spaces/,empty
19,2020-01-20,New organic-metal oxide transistors with high operational stability,"Metal oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), which are built by depositing thin films of an active metal oxide-based semiconducting material on a supporting substrate, have become widely used over the past few years, particularly in organic light-emitting diode displays. Most commercially available devices incorporating these transistors currently rely on metal oxides processed using physical vapor deposition techniques.
Recent studies suggest that there could be more cost-effective ways of fabricating TFTs, for instance, employing solution-based processes. So far, however, these processes have produced transistors with a low carrier mobility and unsatisfactory operational stabilities.
Researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia, University of Oxford in the U.K., and several other institutions worldwide have recently succeeded in fabricating oxide transistors with high electron mobility and operational stability using solution-phase deposition methods. In their study, featured in Nature Electronics, they used solution-processed multilayer channels made of ultrathin layers of indium oxide, zinc oxide nanoparticles, ozone-treated polystyrene and compact zinc oxide.
""We have been working toward resolving a longstanding issue that oxide-semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) have faced since their invention: operational stability,"" Yen-Hung Lin, one of the lead researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. ""This originates from the material properties—abundant non-stochiometric defects, which are responsible for the conductivity of oxide semiconductors. However, these defects are detrimental to device stability under long-hour continuous operation.""
In a series of previous studies, the same team of researchers fabricated multilayer oxide-semiconductor TFTs that performed remarkably well, using different solutions. They also created a multilayer architecture that essentially mimics conventional high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) to create an ""energetic ladder.""
In this multilayer architecture, high-mobility electrons are confined between indium oxide and zinc oxide, creating atomically sharp solution-processed, oxide-oxide heterointerfaces. In their recent paper, the researchers show that adding a UV-ozone treated few-nanometer-thin polystyrene layer to this structure can effectively passivate defects at the oxide-oxide heterointerfaces, which impaired the performance of their previously developed multilayer TFTs.
""We also incorporated zinc oxide nanoparticles or aluminium-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles in the polystyrene layer to further enhance device performance and operational stability,"" Lin explained.
The new approach to fabricate oxide TFTs introduced by Dr. Lin, Prof. Thomas Anthopoulos and their colleagues is simple and effective. One of its key advantages is that it relies on inexpensive solution-processable materials, including indium nitrate, zinc oxide powder, zinc oxide nanoparticles and aluminum-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles.
The TFTs can also be made on flexible substrates, such as polymers or paper, as the devices are fabricated at 200 degrees C. The researchers found that the resulting transistors have the highest operational stability reported in the literature so far under one of the toughest test conditions (i.e., 24-hour continuous operation with high electric flux density).
""We discovered an effective way to deliver a low-temperature, solution-grown, high-performance thin-film transistor with unprecedented operational stability by combining organic materials, which are often the go-to materials for flexible electronics, and oxide semiconductors,"" Lin said. ""Indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), which is currently the incumbent material for thin-film transistors in the post-amorphous-silicon generation, is quickly replacing amorphous silicon as the main material for the global display industry, although it usually requires either a vacuum process or high temperature.""
In the future, the new hybrid organic metal-oxide transistors introduced by Lin and his colleagues could greatly advance the development of flexible electronics. In fact, compared to other solution-processable materials, oxide semiconductors are easier to manufacture, often achieving better electrical performance than other competing technologies. For instance, oxide semiconductors are simpler to produce and perform better than solution-processed 2-D materials, which makes them more suitable for most low-end applications.
""In the future, we plan to extend the application of our multilayer organic-oxide semiconducting channels in other electronic and optoelectronic devices (e.g., radio frequency diodes, photodetectors) due to their high performance and operational stability,"" Lin said. ""We also plan to fabricate transistors and integrated circuits using other scalable, high-throughput manufacturing techniques (e.g. printing or spraying), which could be used in numerous emerging technologies, such as flexible displays and biochemical sensors, among many others.""
